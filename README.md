# dead_mans_handle
Phototransistor-varied dead man始s handle.

### Description
Dead man始s handle realization based on blocking incoming light via operator始s hand. When hand is removed, like due operator始s heart attack, light rays hit phototransistor and program reacts to this crtitical signal. Alarming is done by sending light SOS via Morse sode.

### HW used
- LAMP:bit for micro:bit ([datasheet](https://resources.kitronik.co.uk/pdf/5643-kitronik-lamp-bit-microbit-datasheet.pdf))
- micro:bit v. 2.21 ([specification](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/))
